To verify that the design works as intended, a more extensive evaluation of the final prototype has been made.

\section{The test group}

While it would be beneficial to let the patients---the primary target group---use the final prototype for evaluation purposes, there are several factors to why this is not a good idea. First, patients of this kind are very vulnerable and interaction is better left off for professionals and people with experience or education. Second, the prototype is not fully functional and some actions and gestures are not supported, which could lead to awkward or even harmful moments. Third, the low age of the patients induce a high risk of misunderstandings when it comes to the testing; the prototype can easily mistaken for a final product and a patient may not necessarily understand that the situation is a general case and not tailored to their current situation, possibly leading to further misunderstandings.

At the Children and Youth Clinic, a youth council has been set up to represent the younger patients at the hospital. One person from this council will, together with Thorsen, form the test group for this evaluation.
