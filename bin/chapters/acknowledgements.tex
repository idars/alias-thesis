    I would first and foremost like to show my deep gratitude to my supervisor, Carsten Helgesen. Knowing that he is always there, even when out of town, has been of tremendous value. This thesis would not have been possible without his continuous help.

    I am very grateful for the tons of ideas and creativity brought upon me by senior consultant psychiatrist Paul Joachim Bloch Thorsen. Thank you for letting me toy around with your ideas in this project.

    I would also like to thank Ilona Heldal and Thomas Owren. Your presence in the beginning of the project has been meaningful for me.

    For additional inputs to the project, my appreciation goes to Helse Vest IKT and Avans. Thanks for providing new viewpoints to the project.

    Last but not least, I am thankful for my family and friends who have endured my venture and encouraged me along the way.
