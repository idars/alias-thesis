\section{Analysis of the first design}

\section{Evaluation of prototypes}

When working on the final prototype, it was discovered that the design process did not consider every single case. One example is considering which emoji to display on a procedure after rating it.

The idea is to show emojis that have a higher score than 50 \%, and hide the others. If there is no rating, then a semi-transparent emoji is shown instead. Something that was not thought about was the fact that the user could rate every feeling below 50 \%, resulting in no emojis being shown. It was therefore decided to reflect this situation with a neutral emoji. In that way, it symbolizes the fact that a rating has been given.

The design did also evolve during the prototyping process.
